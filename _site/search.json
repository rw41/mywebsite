I conducted a large-scale simulation comparing 15 factor retention methods (e.g., PA, EGA, CD, RMSEA, TLI, etc.) across 216 design conditions, varying sample size, factor correlation, and loading magnitude.\nThe findings revealed that: - Parallel Analysis (PA) and Exploratory Graph Analysis (EGA) are consistently accurate across most conditions. - EGA-TMFG outperforms EGA-GLASSO in small sample settings. - Fit index‚Äìbased methods (e.g., RMSEA, TLI) perform poorly under high-dimensional settings.\nThis research provides practical guidance for applied researchers conducting EFA in complex psychological and educational datasets."

This project, conducted under the supervision of Dr.¬†Xia, was presented at IMPS 2025. I am currently preparing the manuscript, which is expected to be completed by the end of August.\nA major challenge of this project involves conducting large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. To address this, I developed custom R code specifically designed to run SEM-based simulations efficiently on a Linux system. These simulations are executed on the High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster at UIUC, which significantly accelerates computation and enables greater scalability. To support others working on similar projects, I am also writing a step-by-step tutorial on how to run Monte Carlo simulations for SEMs in R from the Linux shell on HPC systems ‚Äî available under the Code & Tutorials tab.\n\nWu, R., & Xia, Y.
