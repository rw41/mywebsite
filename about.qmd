## Balancing Research and Well-being

While producing high-quality research is my top priority, I believe a meaningful research life goes beyond publications. I care deeply about maintaining both mental and physical health throughout this journey.

## Athletics Background

Before starting research as an undergraduate assistant, I was a student-athlete on the men’s basketball team at Fujian Normal University (FJNU), competing in the [CUABL (Division II)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_University_Basketball_Association) — the Chinese University Association Basketball League. After 10 years of daily training, I made the difficult but necessary decision in my sophomore year to step away from the team and focus fully on academic research.

## Discipline and Fitness

The habits I built as an athlete still shape my life today. I keep a consistent routine, avoid unhealthy habits, and eat healthily. I aim to stay energized, creative, and efficient each day. Daily workouts help me manage stress, especially during intense research periods and heavy coursework. My current personal bests are a 180-pound bench press and a 285-pound squat.

## Coffee, Cars, and Curiosity

I also enjoy brewing coffee—whether hand-pour or espresso—and experimenting with different beans and extraction methods. It mirrors my research mindset: tweaking inputs to achieve the best outcome. Recently, I’ve picked up car repair as a new hobby. I’ve already replaced filters and made some interior upgrades, and I’m eager to keep learning more.
