## Current Research

My current research focuses on evaluating factor retention methods in large factor models. This project, conducted under the supervision of [Dr. Xia](https://education.illinois.edu/profile/yan-xia), was presented at IMPS 2025. I am currently preparing the manuscript, which is expected to be completed by the end of August.

A major challenge of this project involves conducting large-scale Monte Carlo simulations. To address this, I developed custom R code specifically designed to run SEM-based simulations efficiently on a Linux system. These simulations are executed on the [**High-Performance Computing (HPC)**](https://docs.ncsa.illinois.edu/systems/icc/en/latest/index.html) cluster at UIUC, which significantly accelerates computation and enables greater scalability. To support others working on similar projects, I am also writing a step-by-step tutorial on how to run Monte Carlo simulations for SEMs in R from the Linux shell on HPC systems — available under the [Code & Tutorials](experience.qmd) tab.

## Regularization in Complex Data

After completing my previous project on large factor models, I developed a deeper interest in high-dimensional data and complex modeling, particularly in the context of network analysis. Currently, I am studying advanced techniques such as nonconvex regularization methods and Bayesian approaches (e.g., the Bayesian lasso), evaluating their performance and exploring their applications within Structural Equation Modeling (SEM).

## Applied SEM in Real-World Contexts

My third research interest lies in applying Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) to real-world, complex datasets. Recently, I worked on a project using **Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA)** to analyze intensive nominal data from young students’ writing.

## First Introduction to SEM: Emotional Labor Study

During my undergraduate years, I used SEM to examine **multiple mediating pathways** linking emotional labor, well-being, emotional exhaustion, and turnover intentions.
